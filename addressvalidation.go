// Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments addresses.
// Given a postal address, a postal service can deliver items to a premise, P.O.
// Box or similar.
// It is not intended to model geographical locations (roads, towns,
// mountains).
//
// In typical usage an address would be created via user input or from importing
// existing data, depending on the type of process.
//
// Advice on address input / editing:
//   - Use an i18n-ready address widget such as
//     https://github.com/google/libaddressinput)
//   - Users should not be presented with UI elements for input or editing of
//     fields outside countries where that field is used.
//
// For more guidance on how to use this schema, please see:
// https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478
type PostalAddress struct {
	// The schema revision of the `PostalAddress`. This must be set to 0, which is
	// the latest revision.
	//
	// All new revisions **must** be backward compatible with old revisions.
	Revision int32 `json:"revision,omitempty"`
	// Optional. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and
	// https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html for details.
	// Example "CH" for Switzerland. If the region code is not provided, it will be inferred from the address.
	// For best performance, it is recommended to include the region code if you know it. Having
	// inconsistent or repeated regions can lead to poor performance, for example, if the addressLines
	// already includes the region, do not provide the region code again in this field. Supported regions can
	// be found in the FAQ.
	RegionCode string ` json:"regionCode,omitempty"`
	// Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if
	// known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is expected
	// to match one of the languages used in the address' country/region, or their
	// transliterated equivalents.
	// This can affect formatting in certain countries, but is not critical
	// to the correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or
	// other non-formatting related operations.
	//
	// If this value is not known, it should be omitted (rather than specifying a
	// possibly incorrect default).
	//
	// Examples: "zh-Hant", "ja", "ja-Latn", "en".
	LanguageCode string ` json:"languageCode,omitempty"`
	// Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or require
	// postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they may trigger
	// additional validation with other parts of the address (e.g. state/zip
	// validation in the U.S.A.).
	PostalCode string ` json:"postalCode,omitempty"`
	// Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not used
	// in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string like
	// "CEDEX", optionally followed by a number (e.g. "CEDEX 7"), or just a number
	// alone, representing the "sector code" (Jamaica), "delivery area indicator"
	// (Malawi) or "post office indicator" (e.g. CÃ´te d'Ivoire).
	SortingCode string ` json:"sortingCode,omitempty"`
	// Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for postal
	// addresses of a country or region.
	// For example, this can be a state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture.
	// Specifically, for Spain this is the province and not the autonomous
	// community (e.g. "Barcelona" and not "Catalonia").
	// Many countries don't use an administrative area in postal addresses. E.g.
	// in Switzerland this should be left unpopulated.
	AdministrativeArea string ` json:"administrativeArea,omitempty"`
	// Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address.
	// Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town.
	// In regions of the world where localities are not well defined or do not fit
	// into this structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.

	// Optional. Sublocality of the address.
	// For example, this can be neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.
	Sublocality string ` json:"sublocality,omitempty"`
	// Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an address.
	//
	// Because values in address_lines do not have type information and may
	// sometimes contain multiple values in a single field (e.g.
	// "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is clear. The order of
	// address lines should be "envelope order" for the country/region of the
	// address. In places where this can vary (e.g. Japan), address_language is
	// used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for large-to-small ordering and
	// "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large). This way, the most specific line of
	// an address can be selected based on the language.
	//
	// The minimum permitted structural representation of an address consists
	// of a region_code with all remaining information placed in the
	// address_lines. It would be possible to format such an address very
	// approximately without geocoding, but no semantic reasoning could be
	// made about any of the address components until it was at least
	// partially resolved.
	//
	// Creating an address only containing a region_code and address_lines, and
	// then geocoding is the recommended way to handle completely unstructured
	// addresses (as opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be
	// localities or administrative areas).
	AddressLines []string ` json:"addressLines,omitempty"`
